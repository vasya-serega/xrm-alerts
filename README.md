Was forked from origin to bundle into single js file, with embedded CSS and images (using webpack).
This will simplify deployment a lot.
Also this will allow to include the bundle as a dependency into lager bundles and easily publish it as NPM package.

Probably, migrating the code to TypeScript is good idea as well.
