Was forked from origin to bundle into single js file, with embedded CSS and images, to simplify deployment (using webpack).
Also this will allow to include the bundle as a dependency into lager bundles and easily publish it as NPM package.
Probably, migrating the code to TypeScript is good idea as well.
